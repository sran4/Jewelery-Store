## üìä Subtask Breakdown by Priority

### **CRITICAL (Must Complete First)**
1. MongoDB connection and models
2. Admin authentication (login/logout)
3. Product CRUD APIs
4. Cloudinary image upload
5. Admin product management UI

### **HIGH PRIORITY**
6. Image cropping/resizing
7. Flexible image handling (1-5)
8. Contact form database integration
9. SendGrid email notifications
10. Rate limiting

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
11. Bulk operations

14. Settings management
15. Category management

### **LOW PRIORITY (Enhancement)**
16. Google OAuth backup

## üîß Technical Decisions Made

### **Admin Credential Recovery:**
**Solution**: Google OAuth as backup login method
- Admin can login with username/password (primary)
- OR login with Google account (backup)
- Only whitelisted Google email allowed
- No password reset needed - just use Google OAuth

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ No email recovery system needed
- ‚úÖ No security questions
- ‚úÖ Google handles 2FA if enabled
- ‚úÖ Simple and secure
- ‚úÖ Admin always has access

### **Image Quality (5MB Consideration):**
For **crisp, high-quality** images at 5MB:
- **Recommended**: 2000√ó2000px at 72 DPI
- **Format**: JPEG at 90% quality OR WebP
- **Cloudinary** will auto-optimize:
  - Creates multiple sizes
  - Converts to WebP automatically
  - Delivers via CDN
  - Responsive images
  
**Result**: Professional quality while staying under 5MB!

### **Email Service:**
**SendGrid** (Better free tier than EmailJS)
- Free: 100 emails/day
- Better deliverability
- Professional templates
- Analytics included
- Easy integration
